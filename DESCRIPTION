Description: A package that contains the CONCOR (CONvergence of iterated 
    CORrelations) algorithm and a series of supplemental functions for easy 
    running, plotting, and blockmodeling. The CONCOR algorithm is used on 
    social network data to identify network positions based off a definition of
    structural equivalence; see Breiger, Boorman, and Arabie 1975 
    <doi:10.1016/0022-2496(75)90028-0> and Wasserman and Faust's book Social 
    Network Analysis: Methods and Applications (1994). This version
    allows multiple relationships for the same set of nodes and uses both 
    incoming and outgoing ties to find positions.
