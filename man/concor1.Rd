\title{Find +1/-1 convergence points of an input matrix}
\description{
A subfunction of \code{\link{concor}}.

Runs the Pearson correlation on the matrix stack repeatedly until a square matrix
consisting of only +1 and -1 is formed.
}
\usage{
concor1(m_stack, cutoff = .9999999, max_iter = 50)
}
\arguments{
  \item{m_stack}{The stack of input matrices, which must include all transposes and
  relations.}

  \item{cutoff}{The absolute value of the convergence threshold for each matrix element.}

  \item{max_iter}{Maximum number of times to run the correlation while seeking
  convergence.}
}
\details{
For network data with \code{R} relations, the input matrix "stack" is a \code{(2 x N x R) x N} matrix, consistoing of each relation's adjacency matrix, then the transpose of that matrix, appended to each other vertically. The correlation is run until either all matrix entries have absolute values greater than \code{cutoff} or the maximum number of iterations \code{max_iter} is reached. On its own, this function does not execute the whole CONCOR method, but is listed separately from \code{concor} to demonstrate the core step.
}
\value{
A square matrix, with number of rows/columns equal to the number of columns of \code{m_stack}, where the values are either +1 or -1. The input matrix can later be split into two "positions" based off the locations of the positive/negative values.
